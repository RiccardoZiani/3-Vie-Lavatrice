I have been working for this company for more than 20 years.
I have worked for this company since the 90s.
I've been working at this company since before Philips bought it since it was called Saeco
I mainly deal with low level hardware and firmware projects. I deal with the implementation of new microcontroller platforms
 and the development of all the hw/sw components for the introduction of new MCUs
My work can be said to lie somewhere between pure hardware and the sw level of management of coffee machines.
Usually in the implementation of new platforms I deal with low-level porting during the introduction of new MCUs
